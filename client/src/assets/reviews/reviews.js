The paper products were of great quality too. My family enjoyed every second at this house. Oh and there is wine frig too, that was a nice surpise.",

    text: "Our family had an amazing beach vacation here even with the elevator not working until the end of the trip. Overall great place to stay with a large family however if you need the elevator for wheelchair accessibility (luckily we didnt) I'd be hesitant as the elevator seemed a little unreliable.",

    text: "Property was perfectly located within walking distance to boardwalk and restaurants, we didn't have to get in the car once!! We had one very minor issue which did not impact our stay at all, we contacted the host who acknowledged the concern right away. When we booked the house, host was incredibly responsive and flexible, which was greatly appreciated!!",

    text: "This was my first VRBO. I wont lie I was sceptic to say the least. It made me nervous not knowing what to expect. All that went away after communicating with the owners over the few weeks leading up to our arrival. They where great and eased any concerns we may of had. As for the house, wow is all I can say. Trust me you'll love it. The four stories 'counting the car port under the house' make for some fun climbs to help burn off those big vacation meals and trust me I had more than my share. The house is located perfectly in a quit clean neighborhood and is eady walking distance to a great evening desert place called The Peach Cobler or somthing along those lines. As beautiful as this place is the best part and the reason anyone pays extra to book a ocean front house is the view and my god what a view it is. Youll have not one but three ocean front decks to enjoy the ocean view straight off your balcony. Two of which are adjacent to the bed rooms and ones off the living room/ kitchen area. Speaking of the kitchen you'll have plenty of room to cook those big family breakfasts or spread out the pizza boxs for everyone to share. As for the area we had never been to any beach in North Carolina and was hesitant for sure to book our one family vacation to place we had never been, but hey you never know until you try so we went for it. We where blown away with the lack of crowds on the beach and just how clean the they where. Ive stay allot of places but id say this has to be our favorite vacation yet. So if your on the edge of booking i hope this honest review can help guide you into a wonderful vacation home own by some great people.",

    title: "Excellent oceanfront home for large family",
    date: "July 2022",
    text: "My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this beachfront home. It was large enough for my family of six, and each person had their own room for privacy and enjoyment. Most importantly, its oceanfront location and walking distance to coffee shops and restaurants cannot be overlooked. Also, Chris and Melissa were great at responding immediately to our needs. We would love to stay here again for our next visit to Carolina Beach!",
